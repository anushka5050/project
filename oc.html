        You must have observed that iron articles are shiny when new, but get
        coated with a reddish brown powder when left for some time. This process
        is commonly known as rusting of iron. Some other metals also get
        tarnished in this manner. Have you noticed the colour of the coating
        formed on copper and silver? When a metal is attacked by substances
        around it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and this
        process is called corrosion. The black coating on silver and the green
        coating on copper are other examples of corrosion. <br>
        Corrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships
        and to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of
        iron is a serious problem. Every year an enormous amount of money is
        spent to replace damaged iron. You will learn more about corrosion in
        Chapter 3.

            Have you ever tasted or smelt the fat/oil containing food materials left
            for a long time? <br>
            When fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell
            and taste change. Usually substances which prevent oxidation
            (antioxidants) are added to foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food
            in air tight containers helps to slow down oxidation. Do you know that
            chips manufacturers usually flush bags of chips with gas such as
            nitrogen to prevent the chips from getting oxidised ?
