        We have learnt in Class IX that during a chemical reaction atoms of one
        element do not change into those of another element. Nor do atoms
        disappear from the mixture or appear from elsewhere. Actually, chemical
        reactions involve the breaking and making of bonds between atoms to
        produce new substances. You will study about types of bonds formed
        between atoms in Chapters 3 and 4.

            Calcium oxide reacts vigorously with water to produce slaked lime
            (calcium hydroxide) releasing a large amount of heat.

        In this reaction, calcium oxide and water combine to form a single
        product, calcium hydroxide. Such a reaction in which a single product
        is formed from two or more reactants is known as a combination reaction.

        Decomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon
        dioxide on heating is an important decomposition reaction used in
        various industries. Calcium oxide is called lime or quick lime. It has
        many uses – one is in the manufacture of cement. When a decomposition
        reaction is carried out by heating, it is called thermal decomposition.

        In this reaction, iron has displaced or removed another element,
        copper, from copper sulphate solution. This reaction is known as
        displacement reaction.
        Other examples of displacement reactions are-

                You will observe that a white substance, which is
                insoluble in water, is formed. This insoluble substance
                formed is known as a precipitate. Any reaction that
                produces a precipitate can be called a precipitation reaction.

                The white precipitate of BaSO<sub>4</sub> is formed by the
                reaction of SO<sup>2-</sup><sub>4</sub>
                 and Ba<sup>2+</sup>. The other product formed is sodium chloride
                which remains in the solution. Such reactions in which there is an
                exchange of ions between the reactants are called double displacement
                reactions.

                    The surface of copper powder becomes coated with
                    black copper(II) oxide. Why has this black
                    substance formed?<br>
                    This is because oxygen is added to copper and
                    copper oxide is formed.

                    If hydrogen gas is passed over this heated material (CuO), the black
                    coating on the surface turns brown as the reverse reaction takes place
                    and copper is obtained.

                If a substance gains oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be oxidised.
                If a substance loses oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be reduced.
                During this reaction (1.29), the copper(II) oxide is losing oxygen and
                is being reduced. The hydrogen is gaining oxygen and is being oxidised.
                In other words, one reactant gets oxidised while the other gets reduced
                during a reaction. Such reactions are called oxidation-reduction reactions
                or redox reactions.
