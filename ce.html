        Activity 1.1 can be described as – when a magnesium ribbon is burnt in
        oxygen, it gets converted to magnesium oxide. This description of a
        chemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long. It can be written in a
        shorter form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a
        word-equation. <br>
        The word-equation for the above reaction would be –

    <p><font size="+3" face="gabriola">
        The substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (1.1),
        magnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance is
        magnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, as a product.
        </font><br>
    <p><font size="+3" face="gabriola">
        A word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an
        arrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand
        side (LHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. Similarly, products are
        written on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign (+) between them.
        The arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of
        the reaction.

        Is there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations?
        Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use
        chemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a
        chemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and
        magnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as –        
        </font><br>
    <p><font size="+3" face="gabriola">
            Mg + O<sub>2</sub> --> MgO

        Count and compare the number of atoms of each element on the
        LHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the
        same on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not,
        then the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on
        both sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal
        chemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical
        equation for the burning of magnesium in air.

            <h4>Balanced Chemical Equations</h4>
        </font></a>
    <p><font size="+3" face="gabriola">
        Recall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass
        can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the
        total mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction
        has to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.
        </font><br>
    <p><font size="+3" face="gabriola">
        In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the
        same, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a
        skeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.1) balanced? Let us
        learn about balancing a chemical equation step by step. <br>
        The word-equation for Activity 1.1 may be represented as –
        </font><br>
        <p><font size="+3" face="gabriola">
            Mg + O<sub>2</sub> --> MgO
        </font><br>
        <p><font size="+3" face="gabriola">
            Let us examine the number of atoms of different elements on both
            sides of the arrow.
