        Consider the following situations of daily life and think what happens
        when –
        </font>
        <p><font size="+2" face="Arial">
                <ul type="square">
                    <li>milk is left at room temperature during summers</li>
                    <li>an iron tawa/pan/nail is left exposed to humid atmosphere.
                    </li>
                    <li>grapes get fermented.</li>
                    <li>food is cooked.</li>
                    <li>food gets digested in our body.</li>
                    <li>we respire.</li>

            In all the above situations, the nature and the identity of the initial
            substance have somewhat changed. We have already learnt about physical
            and chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical
            change occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place.

            You may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a
            chemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction
            has taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to
            these questions.
            </font><br>

            You must have observed that magnesium ribbon burns with a
            dazzling white flame and changes into a white powder. This powder is
            magnesium oxide. It is formed due to the reaction between magnesium
            and oxygen present in the air.

        From the above three activities, we can say that any of
        the following observations helps us to determine whether
        a chemical reaction has taken place –
        </font><br>
    <p><font size="+2" face="Arial">
            <ul>
                <li>change in state</li>
                <li>change in colour</li>
                <li>evolution of a gas</li>
                <li>change in temperature</li>
                <li>formation of precipitate.</li>
            </ul>

            As we observe the changes around us, we can see
            that there is a large variety of chemical reactions taking
            place around us. We will study about the various types
            of chemical reactions and their symbolic representation
            in this Chapter.
